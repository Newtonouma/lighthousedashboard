# File Upload System Migration to Supabase Storage

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Universal Lighthouse dashboard from local file storage to production-ready Supabase Storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Core Upload Infrastructure
- **Modified `/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`**: 
  - Replaced cloud storage abstraction with direct Supabase Storage integration
  - Maintains local storage fallback for development
  - Improved error handling and file validation

### 2. Enhanced Components
- **Created `/src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`**: 
  - Modern drag & drop interface
  - Upload progress tracking
  - Image preview functionality
  - File validation (size, type)
  - Error handling with user feedback

- **Created `/src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts`**:
  - Reusable upload state management
  - Progress tracking
  - Error handling
  - Type-safe upload results

### 3. Updated Editor Components
- **EventEditor**: Replaced basic file input with enhanced ImageUpload component
- **TeamEditor**: Updated to use new upload system for profile images  
- **GalleryEditor**: Migrated to modern upload interface
- **FullScreenEditor**: Updated to upload multiple files sequentially

### 4. Supabase Storage Integration
- **Updated `/src/lib/cloudinary.ts`**: 
  - Implemented `uploadToSupabase()` function
  - Added `deleteFromSupabase()` for file cleanup
  - Created `getSupabaseFileUrl()` for URL generation
  - Proper content type detection

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# File Upload Settings
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif
```

### Supabase Storage Setup
1. Create a bucket named `dashboard-uploads` in your Supabase project
2. Configure bucket policies for public access:
   ```sql
   -- Allow public access for reading files
   CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'dashboard-uploads');
   
   -- Allow authenticated users to upload files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'dashboard-uploads' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
   ```

## Features

### Production Benefits
- **Persistent Storage**: Files persist across deployments
- **CDN Integration**: Automatic global CDN distribution
- **Scalability**: Handles high traffic and large files
- **Security**: Integrated with Supabase auth system
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-per-use pricing model

### Developer Experience
- **Drag & Drop**: Modern, intuitive upload interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Development Fallback**: Local storage for development

### File Management
- **Validation**: File type and size checking
- **Unique Names**: Automatic filename collision prevention
- **Organization**: Folder-based organization (events, team, gallery, etc.)
- **Cleanup**: Built-in file deletion capabilities

```

## Testing
- Build compilation: ✅ Successful
- TypeScript validation: ✅ No compilation errors
- Component integration: ✅ All editors updated
- API routes: ✅ Supabase integration complete

## Next Steps
1. Set up Supabase Storage bucket and policies
2. Configure environment variables
3. Test upload functionality in development
4. Deploy to production with Supabase configuration
5. Monitor file upload performance and storage usage

## Notes
- Development mode uses local storage as fallback
- Production automatically uses Supabase when properly configured
- All existing uploaded files in `/public/uploads/` remain accessible
- The system is backward compatible with existing image URLs
